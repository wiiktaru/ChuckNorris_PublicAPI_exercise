# ChuckNorris_PublicAPI_exercise

## Description 

ChuckNorris app is a solution created with the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client that integrates Public API (https://api.chucknorris.io/#!). 

With this project I aim to develope understanding of how to integrate public APIs into web projects and how to use Express/Node.js for server-side programming. I practice understanding the client-server communication using Axios and I practice to manipulate, present and owrk with data retrieved from APIs. 

Images folder has an overview.png file for app demo picture.
